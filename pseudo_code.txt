""" NOTES """
-> set backoff_counter between [0, T] initially
-> every time there is a timeout rest backoff_counter between [0, n*T]
-> backoff_counter values need to be different for all hosts
  -> if they're the same there will be a collision


""" QUESTIONS """
-> should we decrement the backoff_counter by 1 if the channel is free during the channel sensing event
