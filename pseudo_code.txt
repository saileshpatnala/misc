arrival event for data packet to new host


NOTES:
-> set backoff_counter between [0, T] initially
-> every time there is a timeout rest backoff_counter between [0, n*T]
-> backoff_counter values need to be different for all hosts
  -> if they're the same there will be a collision



QUESTIONS:
-> we have to assign unique backoff counter between [0, T], and for no collision T needs to be greater than num_hosts. how do we assign the values if T is less than num_hosts

-> the channel can only hold one event right? there is a collision if a host tries to insert an event into the gel

-> what should we set the time to when we create a channel sensing event
